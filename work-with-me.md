I’ve spent my career on both ends of the funnel. I’ve built brands, crafted demand generation campaigns, and managed hundreds of thousands in paid search budget. 

But I’ve also built customer success organizations, most recently managing $20M in ARR at companies in the machine learning as well as the analytics space. Data scientists, engineers, dev ops — generally, highly technical people. 

I’m all about the customer. Attracting them, then keeping them.

And now I help early-stage startups build and implement growth programs that are customer-centric, aligning with their desired outcomes from lead generation through renewal and upsell. 

### Let's get started

I’m currently taking new clients who need to go from zero to one in their customer success efforts, as well as those who need creative and operational help on the marketing side of things.
