title: About Patrick Woods 
---

Hi there, I’m Patrick, and I help startups grow. 

I’ve spent my career on both ends of the funnel. I’ve built brands, crafted demand generation campaigns, and managed hundreds of thousands in paid search budget. 

But I’ve also built customer success organizations, most recently managing $20M in ARR at companies in the machine learning as well as the analytics space. Data scientists, engineers, dev ops — generally, highly technical people. 

**I’m all about the customer. Attracting them, then keeping them.**

In my career, I’ve worked at [Archer Malmo](https://www.archermalmo.com/), [Keen IO](https://keen.io), and [Figure Eight](http://figure-eight.com). 

I then founded [Initial Commit](https://initialcommit.agency) to help early-stage founders find their voice. 

Most recently, I cofounded [Developer Mode](https://developermode.com), an agency that helps companies reach developers in their native tongue: code.
