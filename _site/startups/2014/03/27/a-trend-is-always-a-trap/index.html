<p>&quot;No one ever got fired for buying IBM,&quot; as the saying goes.</p>

<p>IBM here is a metaphor for the safe choice. For jumping on the corporate bandwagon. For following the trends of business. </p>

<p>Trend following might be safe for corporate types, but for startup founders, &quot;safe&quot; is a four-letter word. </p>

<p>Just ask legendary ad man George Lois:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because advertising and marketing is an art, the solution to each new problem or challenge should begin with a blank canvas and an open mind, not with nervous borrowings of other people&#39;s mediocrities. <strong>That&#39;s precisely what &quot;trends&quot; are—a search for something &quot;safe&quot;</strong>—and why a reliance on them leads to oblivion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the risks of trend following, startups are notoriously bad about doing so (see my post <a href="http://patrickwoods.com/startups/2013/05/30/why-does-your-startup-sound-like-a-startup/">Why Does Your Startup Sound Like a Startup?</a> for more). Startup trends appear in homepage layouts, messaging, user acquisition plans, and even approaches to company culture.</p>

<p>But your runway&#39;s shrinking and everything&#39;s on fire and how are you going to make payroll? </p>

<p>This is no time for the safety of other people&#39;s mediocrities. </p>

<p>Lois, again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In any creative industry, the fact that others are moving in a certain direction is always proof positive, at least to me, that <strong>a <em>new</em> direction is the <em>only</em> direction</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds a lot like the startup worldview. So it&#39;s weird that, when, it comes to branding and messaging, so many startups fall into the trend trap of mediocrity and then oblivion. </p>

<p>Disruptive technology, you say? Too bad you look and sound like every other player in your space. </p>

<p>What if your messaging and marketing were as disruptive as your technology? What if your team put in the effort to tell a truly compelling and meaingful brand story that did justice to your product? </p>

<p>Leave the trends to the bloggers and journalists; they need something to write about come January. </p>

<p>By the way, when asked for insight into the coming year&#39;s trends, Lois says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My answer is always identical to what I said the previous year: &quot;Beats the shit out of me. I&#39;ll know it when I do it.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
