    <article><p><img src="/img/steel.jpg" width="100%" alt="Steel"></p>

<p>Are you quiet or outgoing? Playful or serious? Friendly or standoffish? Now what about your startup? What words do you and, more importantly, your customers, use to describe your startup&#39;s personality? </p>

<p>As it turns out, the best way to describe your brand personality is with these kinds of human terms. Brand personality is one of the most visible elements of the <a href="http://brandstrategycanvas.com">Brand Strategy Canvas</a>. And because it&#39;s described in such accessible terms, it&#39;s also one of the most fun to discuss. </p>

<p>When you think about which companies have a strong personality, lots of great examples come to mind. Dollar Shave Club and Old Spice inevitably come up, and for good reason. They&#39;re entertaining and memorable, and seem to resonate with the target audience. </p>

<p>But does personality always have to be funny or entertaining? Is it possible to have a brand personality that&#39;s more serious and reserved, while also being strong and effective? What type of personality makes the most sense for your startup based on your values and your positioning statement? </p>

<p>Strong personalities aren&#39;t so much about being funny or serious or what have you. Rather, <strong>strong brand personalities</strong> are ones that:</p>

<ul>
<li>  are true to the values of the company</li>
<li>  resonate with the target audience, and</li>
<li>  take advantage of an opportunity created by an opening in the competitive set</li>
</ul>

<p>So let&#39;s look at two very different examples of brand personalities. One&#39;s funny, ones&#39; serious, but both authentically communicate their brand in a way that makes sense for their target audience. </p>

<h2>Mailchimp</h2>

<p>Okay, so everyone loves Mailchimp (mail-khimp?). And for good reason. For most users, the product is exactly what they need. I use it for several side projects, and recommend it regularly.  </p>

<p>The MailChimp personality comes through in lots of ways. The name is a big one, as is the mascot: a cartoon chimp. The color palette could be described as friendly and contemporary, as opposed to the more traditional navy blues and grays. </p>

<p>For me, the MailChimp personality really shines in moments of high user stress. If you&#39;ve ever deployed an email campaign, you understand the stress that accompanies pushing the SEND button. Whether there are a million recipients or just a dozen, you don&#39;t want to send out typos or broken links. </p>

<p>Right when you&#39;re about to press Send, this box appears: </p>

<p><img src="/img/monkeyhand.png" width="70%" alt="Monkey Hand"></p>

<p>Yep, a big sweaty monkey hand hovers over a terrifying red button. In this instance of user anxiety, MailChimp introduces a bit of humor to lighten things up. And notice the copy below: &quot;this is your moment of glory.&quot; Okay, says the sender, I can do this. </p>

<p>And when you do, you get this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/hifives.png" width="70%" alt="High Fives"></p>

<p>An animated monkey-hand gives an awesome congratulatory high five. And not just <em>a</em> high five, but &quot;High Fives!&quot; Notice the colloquial usage and the intentional inclusion of the exclamation point. I hate exclamation points in copy, mainly because they don&#39;t typically serve a purpose and rarely fit the brand. But in this case, it works! MailChimp genuinely <em>is</em> excited for you. </p>

<p>You can see how these interface and copy choices flesh-out those traits. It&#39;s a great example of the execution—UI, design, copy—reinforcing the strategy—brand personality. </p>

<p>If MailChimp were to fill-out the <a href="http://brandstrategycanvas.com">Brand Strategy Canvas</a>, this kind of user insight—that the moment of Send causes stress and anxiety—would come through in the very first box. Then, in the positioning statement, it might be included as a pivotal element of the brand strategy. <strong>This is a great example of personality aligning with truths about the target audience</strong>. </p>

<p>From a competitive perspective, the MailChimp brand stands alone among competitors who have taken a more conservative approach to their brand and messaging. Constant Contact, AWeber, and Vertical Response, for example, have largely built their brands around a traditional, conservative approach to email marketing. And into this milieu, you&#39;ve got the quirky, friendly MailChimp brand. </p>

<p>Okay, we know Mailchimp is a funny and powerful brand overall. In fact, lot&#39;s of startups go the tongue-in-cheek direction. And that&#39;s totally fine as long as it&#39;s true to your actual personality, values, and what you discovered in the positioning statement and Canvas overall. </p>

<p>That said, sometimes exclamation points and jokes don&#39;t make sense. Is it possible to have a strong personality if that&#39;s the case? Absolutely. </p>

<h2>Harlan Estate</h2>

<p>Take <a href="http://harlanestate.com">Harlan Estate</a>. A producer of high-end wines in Napa, Harlan Estate has built a brand around exclusivity and quality. Were they to complete the Brand Strategy Canvas, they would likely describe their target audience as discerning, both of wine and of culture. They take pride in exclusive experiences, and have the income  to spend on expensive wines (on the secondary markets, Harlan wines have been known to go for $800+ per bottle). </p>

<p>To gain the <em>privilege</em> of buying a single bottle—not even a case—of Harlan Estate wines, potential customers must first add themselves to the mailing list on the website. Eventually, they&#39;ll receive an <em>invitation</em> to purchases their first bottle. </p>

<p><img src="/img/harlan.png" width="100%" alt="Harlan Estate"></p>

<p>As you&#39;ll notice, their website is sparse, and minimalistic. The type and background on the homepage evokes paper money. There are no animations or transitions. And it relies heavily on rich black and white photography (which happens to look pretty awesome). </p>

<p>There are also some very opinionated pieces of copy as well. They&#39;re not necessarily in headlines, but are largely buried in PDFs, which, I imagine, is another deliberate choice. In his <em>Note from the Proprietor</em>, H. William Harlan (is he named after a 19th century robber baron?) says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the quarter of a century since we found our particular piece of land above Oakville, our knowledge of it has deepened and our understanding of wine’s great traditions have broadened. Yet we have only just begun to understand this land sufficiently to bring it into its current form. And I feel that is as it should be, for fine wines evolve over decades, and winegrowing estates, families, and communities across generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/william.png" width="100%" alt="H. William"></p>

<p>This guy has done serious thinking about his craft. And that is fantastic. This is an example of a brand with an incredibly clear sense of identity. As you might imagine, exclamation points, animations, and mascots would make zero sense in this context. </p>

<p>If you were describing your pal Harlan Estate, you might say he&#39;s serious but has great taste, dedicated to his craft and is unwavering in his commitment to excellence. He&#39;s refined and reserved, authentic and honest. </p>

<p>If you had a friend who wasn&#39;t a fan of Harlan, they might say he&#39;s snobby, a bit condescending, and probably inaccessible. But that&#39;s okay. Because Harlan Estate does what&#39;s true to who it is, and there are plenty of people who identify with that, and, as a result, buy their expensive wines. </p>

<p>In this case, Harlan Estate has a very clear picture of its target audience as well as the market opportunity for super-exclusive wine. Into that context, they&#39;ve asserted their values, which, when executed, express themselves through the design and copy choices made above. </p>

<h2>the takeaway</h2>

<p>In the overlap of those three key ares of the Brand Strategy Canvas—customer insight, competitive environment, and company values—MailChimp and Harlan Estate have successfully created strong brand personalities that resonate with their audience and leverage an opportunity in the competitive space. </p>

<p><strong>And most importantly, their personalities are authentic</strong>. By &quot;authentic,&quot; I mean that the the expression of their personalities is true to their values. The personalities don&#39;t feel manufactured or contrived, because they aren&#39;t. Indeed, they are rooted in truth. </p>

<p>Personality is only one part of a strong brand strategy, but because it&#39;s so visible and experiential, it&#39;s among the most crucial. Of all areas of the canvas, personality provides the most tangible connection between your strategic choices and how the world experiences that strategy. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what brand personality is all about: dialing-in to what you believe, and communicating those beliefs in a way that&#39;s true. Your execution, i.e. copy, colors, UI, design, should always support decisions made in your brand strategy. </p>

<p>In that context, personality can be seen as a helpful bridge between the core of your strategy set forth in your positioning statement, and the more tangible artifacts of your brand. </p>

<p>We had a lot of fun in 2014 at <a href="http://archermalmo.com/ventures">archer&gt;malmo ventures</a>. We created the <a href="http://brandstrategycanvas.com">Brand Strategy Canvas</a> and conducted workshops for some of the best startups and accelerators in the world. We started working with some great <a href="http://keen.io">friends</a>. We were also named a top 10 agency for startup by <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/agency/top-agencies-startups-2014-edition">Agency Post</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve had this feeling lately that I&#39;m on, or arriving at, a plateau. archer&gt;malmo ventures is in its third year, things are going well, and I can&#39;t help but sense that things are getting a little too comfortable. Never a good sign. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a reader, so I always look to the written word for guidance and inspiration. I&#39;m also lucky to have a lot of really smart and creative friends to turn to for input and advice in times like this. So I reached out on Twitter to get their thoughts on what to read next. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I got the conversation going: </p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br>
And thankfully, within an hour or so, I had more than a dozen recommendations from friends and strangers alike. It&#39;s a great mix of fiction and nonfiction, with challenging reads on topics ranging from creativity to productivity to philosophy. </p>

<p>Without further adieu, here&#39;s the list (in chronological order):</p>

    <article><p><img src="/img/aquaduct.jpg" width="100%" alt="Aquaduct"></p>

<p>I&#39;m jealous of writers. Fiction, history, biography, short stories—I envy the good writers across genre. Writers tell stories, they convey information, they move their audiences from one point to another, leaving them changed in the process. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I love reading about how writers write. When they write, the process they follow for arriving at a narrative, even the tools they use and the desks where they sit. </p>

<p>On of my favorite accounts of a writer&#39;s process is Stephen King&#39;s class <em><a href="href=%22http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC0SIM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC0SIM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=actionalysis-20&amp;linkId=ZT57NMX46UZITQTG%22%3EOn%20Writing:%20A%20Memoir%20Of%20The%20Craft">On Writing</a></em>. King starts with the story of his childhood, college, and early marriage. After providing this humorous, sometimes moving, look into his autobiography, King moves on to the details of how we works. Where he sits, when he writes, how often he writes.  </p>

<p>In one section, he unpacks what amounts to his view of Story. Where do stories come from? How do you know a good one? </p>

<p>In King&#39;s view, stories are fossils. In other words, the stories exist already, much like Michelangelo would say the sculpture is there, waiting, inside the block of marble. The ideas have been there since the beginning of time. Someone just needs to uncover them. In this sense, authors are archeologists. </p>

    <article><p><img src="/img/shackleton.jpg" width="100%" alt="Shackleton Expedition"></p>

<p>A few nights ago, Netflix, in its infinite wisdom, suggested the delightful indie comedy <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1862079/">Safety Not Guaranteed</a></em>. The story begins with a curious newspaper classified that reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You&#39;ll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the film unfolds, the viewer uncovers what one critic deemed a &quot;plaintive underlying theme about the fading dreams of those aspiring professionals in their 20s and 30s not swept up in the high-tech and financial gold rush.&quot; </p>

<p>In other words, ours is a cynical-yet-hopeful generation. If wealth is no longer an attainable analogue for happiness, we&#39;ll redefine happiness by emphasizing experience over possessions. </p>

<p>While this attitude seems thoroughly post-modern, the desire for meaningful experience isn&#39;t unique to the 20- and 30-somethings of the past decade. </p>

<p>Consider the following job posting, which sounds a lot like the one above, dating from 1912:</p>

    <article><p>When building a two-sided marketplace, the chicken vs. egg anology </p>

<p>&quot;No one ever got fired for buying IBM,&quot; as the saying goes.</p>

<p>IBM here is a metaphor for the safe choice. For jumping on the corporate bandwagon. For following the trends of business. </p>

<p>Trend following might be safe for corporate types, but for startup founders, &quot;safe&quot; is a four-letter word. </p>

<p>Just ask legendary ad man George Lois:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because advertising and marketing is an art, the solution to each new problem or challenge should begin with a blank canvas and an open mind, not with nervous borrowings of other people&#39;s mediocrities. <strong>That&#39;s precisely what &quot;trends&quot; are—a search for something &quot;safe&quot;</strong>—and why a reliance on them leads to oblivion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the risks of trend following, startups are notoriously bad about doing so (see my post <a href="http://patrickwoods.com/startups/2013/05/30/why-does-your-startup-sound-like-a-startup/">Why Does Your Startup Sound Like a Startup?</a> for more). Startup trends appear in homepage layouts, messaging, user acquisition plans, and even approaches to company culture.</p>

<p>But your runway&#39;s shrinking and everything&#39;s on fire and how are you going to make payroll? </p>

<p>This is no time for the safety of other people&#39;s mediocrities. </p>

<p>Lois, again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In any creative industry, the fact that others are moving in a certain direction is always proof positive, at least to me, that <strong>a <em>new</em> direction is the <em>only</em> direction</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds a lot like the startup worldview. So it&#39;s weird that, when, it comes to branding and messaging, so many startups fall into the trend trap of mediocrity and then oblivion. </p>

<p>Disruptive technology, you say? Too bad you look and sound like every other player in your space. </p>

<p>What if your messaging and marketing were as disruptive as your technology? What if your team put in the effort to tell a truly compelling and meaningful brand story that did justice to your product?</p>

<p>Leave the trends to the bloggers and journalists; they need something to write about come January. </p>

<p>By the way, when asked for insight into the coming year&#39;s trends, Lois says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My answer is always identical to what I said the previous year: &quot;Beats the shit out of me. I&#39;ll know it when I do it.&quot; </p>
