Don Draper for startups? The startup brand whisperer? I really need to get a copywriter to look at this. 

Point is, I'm Patrick, and I'm a hybrid ad man/startup guy, with several years of experience bridging the best of both worlds. 

I represent the venturing arm of [archer>malmo](http://archermalmo.com), where we build brands for early-stage startups, either for equity or for fees that make sense for where you are. 

I'm also really proud of the [Brand Strategy Canvas](http://brandstrategycanvas.com). It's a tool we made to help startups actualy *do* brand strategy. Check it out.
