When building a two-sided marketplace, the chicken vs. egg anology 


"No one ever got fired for buying IBM," as the saying goes.

IBM here is a metaphor for the safe choice. For jumping on the corporate bandwagon. For following the trends of business. 

Trend following might be safe for corporate types, but for startup founders, "safe" is a four-letter word. 

Just ask legendary ad man George Lois:

> Because advertising and marketing is an art, the solution to each new problem or challenge should begin with a blank canvas and an open mind, not with nervous borrowings of other people's mediocrities. **That's precisely what "trends" are—a search for something "safe"**—and why a reliance on them leads to oblivion. 

Despite the risks of trend following, startups are notoriously bad about doing so (see my post <a href="http://patrickwoods.com/startups/2013/05/30/why-does-your-startup-sound-like-a-startup/">Why Does Your Startup Sound Like a Startup?</a> for more). Startup trends appear in homepage layouts, messaging, user acquisition plans, and even approaches to company culture.

But your runway's shrinking and everything's on fire and how are you going to make payroll? 

This is no time for the safety of other people's mediocrities. 

Lois, again:

> In any creative industry, the fact that others are moving in a certain direction is always proof positive, at least to me, that **a _new_ direction is the _only_ direction**. 

Sounds a lot like the startup worldview. So it's weird that, when, it comes to branding and messaging, so many startups fall into the trend trap of mediocrity and then oblivion. 

Disruptive technology, you say? Too bad you look and sound like every other player in your space. 

What if your messaging and marketing were as disruptive as your technology? What if your team put in the effort to tell a truly compelling and meaningful brand story that did justice to your product?

Leave the trends to the bloggers and journalists; they need something to write about come January. 

By the way, when asked for insight into the coming year's trends, Lois says:

> My answer is always identical to what I said the previous year: "Beats the shit out of me. I'll know it when I do it."
