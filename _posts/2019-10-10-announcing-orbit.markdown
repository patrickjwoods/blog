<img src="{{ root }}/img/orbit.png" width="100%" alt="Orbit - Developer Relationship Management">

I’m excited to announce the founding of [Orbit](https://orbit.love), the world’s first [Developer Relationship Management](https://orbit.love) platform. 

After hundreds of conversations with client at DeveloperMode, we decided to go all-in on building a product to help companies build and grow developer relationships. 

Based on the [Orbit Model for Developer Relations](https://developermode.com/blog/orbit-model-vs-funnel-for-developer-relations/), Orbit helps team manage relationships, not spreadsheets. 

Apply for early access at [orbit.love](https://orbit.love).
