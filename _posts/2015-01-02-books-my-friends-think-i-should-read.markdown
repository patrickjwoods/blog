We had a lot of fun in 2014 at [archer>malmo ventures](http://archermalmo.com/ventures). We created the [Brand Strategy Canvas](http://brandstrategycanvas.com) and conducted workshops for some of the best startups and accelerators in the world. We started working with some great [friends](http://keen.io). We were also named a top 10 agency for startup by [Agency Post](http://blog.hubspot.com/agency/top-agencies-startups-2014-edition).


On the other hand, I've had this feeling lately that I'm on, or arriving at, a plateau. archer>malmo ventures is in its third year, things are going well, and I can't help but sense that things are getting a little too comfortable. Never a good sign. 

I'm a reader, so I always look to the written word for guidance and inspiration. I'm also lucky to have a lot of really smart and creative friends to turn to for input and advice in times like this. So I reached out on Twitter to get their thoughts on what to read next. 

Here's how I got the conversation going: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Whatâ€™s the 1 book I should read in the next 2 weeks to level-up in the coming months, professionally/personally? cc <a href="https://twitter.com/dorkitude">@dorkitude</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dzello">@dzello</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/elof">@elof</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Woods (@patrickjwoods) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods/status/546413774450606080">December 20, 2014</a></blockquote>

<br>
And thankfully, within an hour or so, I had more than a dozen recommendations from friends and strangers alike. It's a great mix of fiction and nonfiction, with challenging reads on topics ranging from creativity to productivity to philosophy. 

Without further adieu, here's the list (in chronological order):

### What did I pick? 

Lots of great options here, but I've decided to start with _The Power of Habit_. I've only heard great things. and also that it's a quick read, which is nice. I'm roughly 40% into it so far, and I've been blown away by the usable info it presents. I've found myself applying its principles already. 

As you can tell, I've got quite the to-read list for 2015. But I'm always looking for more. Did I miss anything? Tweet me [@patrickjwoods](https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods) to let me know.
