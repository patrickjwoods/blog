<p>Who is your competition? For many tech startups, you may not have direct, heads-up competition. If you’re a diet soda, you have lots of direct competitors.</p>

<p>In established categories, like soft drinks, laundry detergents, deodorants, and pretty much any other CPG, each brand works hard to find some opportunity to exploit.</p>

<p>“We’re the diet soda <em>with Splenda</em>.”</p>

<p>“We’re the diet soda <em>with no caffeine</em>.”</p>

<p>“We’re caffeine-free diet cherry soda!”</p>

<p>This arms race of product augmentation warrants its own post, but for now, it’s important to note that startups often face a less crowded competitive landscape. In the soda examples above, each description assumes a baseline descriptor, e.g. Diet Soda, then differentiates with some sort of addition, e.g. Cherry Flavored.</p>

<p>But what if you’re <em>creating a market</em> where there wasn’t one? How do you describe your widget if there are no other widgets for people to buy?</p>
