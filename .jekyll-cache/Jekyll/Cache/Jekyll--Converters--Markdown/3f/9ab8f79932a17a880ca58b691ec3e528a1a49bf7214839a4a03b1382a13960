<p>Thereâ€™s plenty of trite advice out there on how to name your startup. Just google â€œstartup naming adviceâ€ and youâ€™ll find all sorts of <em>10 Tricks to Name Your Startup!</em> and other bullet-filled listicles. Much of the name-related content would lead you to believe that naming is easy. Just follow these steps and youâ€™ll be fine.</p>

<p>Thing is, finding a good name is hard. There are no shortcuts. Sure, you <em>can</em> pick a name at random and just go with it. But <strong>your name is the first element of your brand a potential user experiences</strong>. Itâ€™s the tip of the spear, and it should be sharp.</p>

<p>The good news is that others have done this before. My team has named many startups, and even more non-startup brands. Iâ€™ve worked with them to distill the key steps they follow when working on a naming project (shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/_danprice">Dan Price</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sloganeerist">Justin Dobbs</a>, my two favorite brand pros). There are lots of processes out there, but this is the one that works for us.</p>

<p>There are four main parts to our approachâ€”Foundation, Generation, Evaluation, and Validation. Each step is important, and the success of each phase depends on the quality of work you put forth in the prior stage.</p>

<p>It may not be quick, but itâ€™s worth it. And when youâ€™re finished, youâ€™ll have a name that means something, that starts a conversation about something true in your brand. To me, thatâ€™s a lot better than picking a random word from the thesaurus and hoping for the best.</p>
