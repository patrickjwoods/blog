<p>I’m jealous of writers. Fiction, history, biography, short stories—I envy the good writers across genre. Writers tell stories, they convey information, they move their audiences from one point to another, leaving them changed in the process.</p>

<p>That’s why I love reading about how writers write. When they write, the process they follow for arriving at a narrative, even the tools they use and the desks where they sit.</p>

<p>On of my favorite accounts of a writer’s process is Stephen King’s class <em><a href="href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC0SIM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC0SIM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=actionalysis-20&amp;linkId=ZT57NMX46UZITQTG&quot;&gt;On Writing: A Memoir Of The Craft">On Writing</a></em>. King starts with the story of his childhood, college, and early marriage. After providing this humorous, sometimes moving, look into his autobiography, King moves on to the details of how we works. Where he sits, when he writes, how often he writes.</p>

<p>In one section, he unpacks what amounts to his view of Story. Where do stories come from? How do you know a good one?</p>

<p>In King’s view, stories are fossils. In other words, the stories exist already, much like Michelangelo would say the sculpture is there, waiting, inside the block of marble. The ideas have been there since the beginning of time. Someone just needs to uncover them. In this sense, authors are archeologists.</p>
