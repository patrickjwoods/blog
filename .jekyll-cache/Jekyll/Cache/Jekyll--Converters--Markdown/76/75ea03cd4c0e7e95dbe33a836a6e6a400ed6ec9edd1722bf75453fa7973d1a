I"Â	<p>When building a two-sided marketplace, the chicken vs. egg anology</p>

<p>â€œNo one ever got fired for buying IBM,â€ as the saying goes.</p>

<p>IBM here is a metaphor for the safe choice. For jumping on the corporate bandwagon. For following the trends of business.</p>

<p>Trend following might be safe for corporate types, but for startup founders, â€œsafeâ€ is a four-letter word.</p>

<p>Just ask legendary ad man George Lois:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because advertising and marketing is an art, the solution to each new problem or challenge should begin with a blank canvas and an open mind, not with nervous borrowings of other peopleâ€™s mediocrities. <strong>Thatâ€™s precisely what â€œtrendsâ€ areâ€”a search for something â€œsafeâ€</strong>â€”and why a reliance on them leads to oblivion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the risks of trend following, startups are notoriously bad about doing so (see my post <a href="http://patrickwoods.com/startups/2013/05/30/why-does-your-startup-sound-like-a-startup/">Why Does Your Startup Sound Like a Startup?</a> for more). Startup trends appear in homepage layouts, messaging, user acquisition plans, and even approaches to company culture.</p>

<p>But your runwayâ€™s shrinking and everythingâ€™s on fire and how are you going to make payroll?</p>

<p>This is no time for the safety of other peopleâ€™s mediocrities.</p>

<p>Lois, again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In any creative industry, the fact that others are moving in a certain direction is always proof positive, at least to me, that <strong>a <em>new</em> direction is the <em>only</em> direction</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds a lot like the startup worldview. So itâ€™s weird that, when, it comes to branding and messaging, so many startups fall into the trend trap of mediocrity and then oblivion.</p>

<p>Disruptive technology, you say? Too bad you look and sound like every other player in your space.</p>

<p>What if your messaging and marketing were as disruptive as your technology? What if your team put in the effort to tell a truly compelling and meaningful brand story that did justice to your product?</p>

<p>Leave the trends to the bloggers and journalists; they need something to write about come January.</p>

<p>By the way, when asked for insight into the coming yearâ€™s trends, Lois says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My answer is always identical to what I said the previous year: â€œBeats the shit out of me. Iâ€™ll know it when I do it.â€</p>
