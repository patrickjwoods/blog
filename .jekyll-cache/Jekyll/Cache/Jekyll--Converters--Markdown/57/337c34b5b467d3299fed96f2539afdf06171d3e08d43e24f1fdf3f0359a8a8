<p>We had a lot of fun in 2014 at <a href="http://archermalmo.com/ventures">archer&gt;malmo ventures</a>. We created the <a href="http://brandstrategycanvas.com">Brand Strategy Canvas</a> and conducted workshops for some of the best startups and accelerators in the world. We started working with some great <a href="http://keen.io">friends</a>. We were also named a top 10 agency for startup by <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/agency/top-agencies-startups-2014-edition">Agency Post</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Iâ€™ve had this feeling lately that Iâ€™m on, or arriving at, a plateau. archer&gt;malmo ventures is in its third year, things are going well, and I canâ€™t help but sense that things are getting a little too comfortable. Never a good sign.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a reader, so I always look to the written word for guidance and inspiration. Iâ€™m also lucky to have a lot of really smart and creative friends to turn to for input and advice in times like this. So I reached out on Twitter to get their thoughts on what to read next.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how I got the conversation going:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Whatâ€™s the 1 book I should read in the next 2 weeks to level-up in the coming months, professionally/personally? cc <a href="https://twitter.com/dorkitude">@dorkitude</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dzello">@dzello</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/elof">@elof</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Woods (@patrickjwoods) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods/status/546413774450606080">December 20, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p><br />
And thankfully, within an hour or so, I had more than a dozen recommendations from friends and strangers alike. Itâ€™s a great mix of fiction and nonfiction, with challenging reads on topics ranging from creativity to productivity to philosophy.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, hereâ€™s the list (in chronological order):</p>

<p>Lots of great options here, but Iâ€™ve decided to start with <em>The Power of Habit</em>. Iâ€™ve only heard great things. and also that itâ€™s a quick read, which is nice. Iâ€™m roughly 40% into it so far, and Iâ€™ve been blown away by the usable info it presents. Iâ€™ve found myself applying its principles already.</p>

<p>As you can tell, Iâ€™ve got quite the to-read list for 2015. But Iâ€™m always looking for more. Did I miss anything? Tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods">@patrickjwoods</a> to let me know.</p>
