<p><em>This article originally appeared on my <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/a-simple-technique-for-better-b2b-headlines-efc50882f1cb">Medium Blog</a>.</em></p>

<p>Startups have to write a lot, especially those in B2B categories. Cranking out blog posts, product launches, and various types of emails is tough. In the whirlwind of deadlines and KPIs, it‚Äôs easy to lose site of the people on the other side of those emails.</p>

<p>But when that happens, you find yourself on the slippery slope of <strong>brand narcissism</strong>, losing all touch with customer empathy.</p>

<p>But effective writing is customer-centric and helps to answer the So What? of your business. The problem is that much B2B writing is self-centered and doesn‚Äôt help customers view themselves in the company‚Äôs narrative.</p>

<p>This is evident in headlines like ‚ÄúThe easiest way to send transactional emails‚Äù or ‚ÄúIncreased productivity for teams.‚Äù They‚Äôre trying to speak to customer benefits, but fail to draw the customer in.</p>

<p>In her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LMB5P0G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><em>Everybody Writes</em></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/annhandley?lang=en">Ann Handley</a> , Chief Content Officer of <a href="https://www.marketingprofs.com/">MarketingProfs</a>, among other things, shares a tip that I‚Äôve found incredibly clear and immediately actionable for avoiding self-centered copy. She says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use a customer-centric POV. Replace <em>I</em> or <em>we</em> with <em>you</em> to shift the focus to the customer‚Äôs point of view. Then write (or rewrite) accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She follows with several examples, including:</p>

<p><strong>Company-centric</strong>: We offer accelerated application development.</p>

<p><strong>Customer-centric</strong>: Deploy an app to the cloud at lunch hour. And still have time to eat. (From the home page of Kinvey.com)</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p><strong>Company-centric</strong>: A Better Way to Learn How to Cook.</p>

<p><strong>Customer-centric</strong>: Become a Cook in 30 Days</p>

<p>You can see how the customer-centric examples are talking to real people about problems the company can solve. You can also see that these headlines are just more interesting, <em>providing a rich point of departure for the remaining copy</em>.</p>

<p>Take a look at your homepage. Does it read more like the company-centric examples, or the customer-centric ones? How can you take the benefits you‚Äôve already highlighted and reframe the the insight with the customer front and center?</p>

<p>As you implement this thinking, you‚Äôll find that an empathic approach will help you connect with customers and differentiate from others your B2B category.</p>

<p>The demand of content production probably won‚Äôt ease up anytime soon, but with the customer as your guiding light, you can at least ensure your team‚Äôs efforts are all pointed in the same direction and that you‚Äôre telling a cohesive and customer-centric story.</p>
