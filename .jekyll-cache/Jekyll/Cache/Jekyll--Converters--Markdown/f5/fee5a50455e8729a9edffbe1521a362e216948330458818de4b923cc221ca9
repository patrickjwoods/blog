<p>Iâ€™m excited to announce the founding of <a href="https://orbit.love">Orbit</a>, the worldâ€™s first <a href="https://orbit.love">Developer Relationship Management</a> platform.</p>

<p>After hundreds of conversations with client at DeveloperMode, we decided to go all-in on building a product to help companies build and grow developer relationships.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href="https://developermode.com/blog/orbit-model-vs-funnel-for-developer-relations/">Orbit Model for Developer Relations</a>, Orbit helps team manage relationships, not spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Apply for early access at <a href="https://orbit.love">orbit.love</a>.</p>
